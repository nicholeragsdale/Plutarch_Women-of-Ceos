# Notes

- Italicize *Moralia* everywhere.
- Remove spaces between periods and footnote marks.
- Reduce footnote lables to one word
- In the "Plutarch" section, remove "intelligent" but add a sentence about how P. and C. had a philosophical discuss.
- "it was essentially unheard of in ancient Greece" replace with something to the effect that Plutarch finds it interesting enough to write about. The contrast can be [today] "not noteworthy" but "Plutarch bothers to write about."
- Paragraph around line 36: You can note that public constraint on bad behavior and private virtue are not exclusive, but complementary.
- after "gossip"â€¦ the word you are looking for is "deterrent".
- possible alternatives for "romantic endeavors": "courtship and marriage", "romantic life"??
- Merge the two concluding paragraphs.
