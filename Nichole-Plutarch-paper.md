# "The Women of Ceos" in Plutarch's *On the Excellence of Women*

## Introduction

The "Women of Ceos" is one of many essays in Plutarch's collection of essays, *On the Excellence of Women*. This work was originally written in Ancient Greek in the 2nd Century BCE. The version of the text that I worked with was translated by Frank Cole Babbitt, published in 1931.[^babbitt] A transcription of Babbitt's translation was published as HTML in the early 21st Century by Bill Thayer.[^Thayer] I am publishing this digital edition of Plutarch's essay "The Women of Ceos" from _On the Excellence of Women_ under an open license, with documentation.

## Plutarch

Born in 46 CE in Greece, Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus, or Plutarch, was the son of a biographer and philosopher.[^Britannica] During his lifetime he became a husband, father, and Roman citizen.[^Britannica] He died in 120 CE, thirty years after he became a priest in Delphi, Greece.[^ODC] Plutarch is most famous for his work *Parallel Lives*.[^OCD] He also wrote other works which are apart of his *Moralia* collection. Works within this collection provide insight into the everyday lives of the ancient Romans and Greeks. Many have underlying themes of ethics that is shared with and taught to the reader.[^Stanford] "On Brotherly Love" and "On the Fortune or the Virtue of Alexander" are two works in the *Moralia*.[^Moralia] "On Brotherly Love" is about the affections and respect that siblings have for each other.[^Brotherly] "On the Fortune or the Virtue of Alexander" discusses the king Alexander the Great.[^Alexander] *On the Excellence of Women* is another work in the *Moralia*. It is about the brave and morally correct deeds done by women. He dedicated this work to a woman, his friend Clea. Clea was a priestess at Delphi who Plutarch had philosophical discussions with. Plutarch also dedicated some of his *Moralia* works to Clea.

## "The Women of Ceos"

Plutarch's essay on "The Women of Ceos" describes the romantic endeavors of the women of Ceos.

He begins by stating that “maidens” go to “public shrines” together. These maidens, or unmarried women, would be at these shrines for the majority of their day. According to one source, while there they would perform “sports and dances” for their on looking suitors. According to another source, the women would entertain themselves though dance or some other energetic activity while their suitors would “behold how prettily they sported and danced about.”[^Virtues] The first source gives off the impression that women are playing sports while men watch. While in today’s society this is not noteworthy activity, Plutarch found it interesting and unordinary enough to write about. The second source provides clarity as its translation implies that the suitors are happily observing the maidens frolic about. As used in the second source, “sported” is defined as “to amuse oneself.”[^Virtues] This small difference in translation has a large effect on the understanding of the text. Despite this contradicting information the conclusion has been reached that the maidens go to public shrines together to essentially get the attention of their suitors.

After the maidens have spent most of their day at the public shrines they then go to each other’s houses’ to wait on one another’s “parents and brothers.” The brothers of their fellow maidens are potential suitors for the women. Their style of waiting on them is described as “officiously.”[^Virtues] Officious is defined as “volunteering one's services where they are neither asked nor needed.”[^Webster] The women are even said to wash the families’ feet. In ancient Greece, the washing of elder’s feet is seen as a sign of respect.[^TJC] The women are volunteering their unneeded services to get more exposure to their suitors and to show their potential in-laws respect. They also volunteer these services to show that they are not afraid of hard work, or as the saying goes to “get their hands dirty.”  

Plutarch then continues on by stating that when a woman becomes engaged she no longer pursues relationships with other suitors. This devotion on the part of the women of Ceos results in there being no “adultery or seduction” in the country for over 700 years. Through this devotion women are showing their significant others respect. This also shows that the women of Ceos are loyal to their partners and are strong-willed as they are able to resist the numerous other suitors that adore them. One reason for this long streak of fidelity could be that since all their courtships were so public, if one of the partners in a relationship was unfaithful it would quickly be spread as gossip. Public constraint on bad behavior and private virtue are not exclusive, but complementary. A remaining, unanswered question is what happened to change this long streak of no adultery after 700 years? Plutarch put that specific number of years in the short essay for a reason, but does not tell us what ended this streak of loyalty.

Keeping all of this in mind, we see that Plutarch manages to fit a young women’s entire romantic life in this short essay. He begins by stating that the young women go to public shrines in order to have men look at them. After this they go to each other’s houses’ to wait hand and foot on their families in order to get more exposure to suitors. Then women are engaged and no longer pursue relationships with other suitors. Plutarch breaks down a young women’s romantic endeavors into four sentences.

## Short Conclusion

In the four sentences of the short essay we see the message that Plutarch is trying to convey: Women are ostentatious, hardworking, diligent, respectful, determined, loyal, and strong-willed individuals that deserve some credit. Through writing this work Plutarch is recognizing women in order to award them some of the credit and praise that they deserve. We can conclude that Plutarch is writing for the general public as to point out to them the qualities and brave achievements and stories of women.
